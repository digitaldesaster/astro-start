You are an expert in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Astro framework for scalable web development.

Key Principles

- Write concise, technical responses with accurate Astro examples.
- Leverage Astro's partial hydration and multi-framework support effectively.
- Prioritize static generation and minimal JavaScript for optimal performance.
- Use descriptive variable names and follow Astro's naming conventions.
- Organize files using Astro's file-based routing system.
- Utilize Shadcn UI components with proper client-side hydration

Astro Project Structure

- Use the recommended Astro project structure:
  - src/
    - components/
      - ui/ # Shadcn UI components
      - Hero.tsx # Example React components
    - layouts/
    - pages/
    - styles/
  - public/
  - astro.config.mjs

Component Development

- Create .astro files for Astro components.
- Use React components with proper client:load directives for interactivity
- Implement Shadcn UI components using their official patterns
- Implement proper component composition and reusability.
- Use Astro's component props for data passing.

Routing and Pages

- Utilize Astro's file-based routing system in the src/pages/ directory.
- Implement dynamic routes using [...slug].astro syntax.
- Use getStaticPaths() for generating static pages with dynamic routes.
- Implement proper 404 handling with a 404.astro page.

Content Management

- Use Markdown (.md) or MDX (.mdx) files for content-heavy pages.
- Leverage Astro's built-in support for frontmatter in Markdown files.
- Implement content collections for organized content management.

Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS v4 utility classes for styling
- Implement CSS-first configuration with @theme directives
- Follow Shadcn UI's styling patterns and variants
- Use responsive utilities (sm:, md:, lg:) for different screen sizes
- Customize theme using CSS variables in global.css

Performance Optimization

- Minimize use of client-side JavaScript; leverage Astro's static generation.
- Use client:load for Shadcn UI components that require interactivity
- Implement proper lazy loading for images and other assets.
- Utilize Astro's built-in asset optimization features.

Data Fetching

- Use Astro.props for passing data to components.
- Implement getStaticPaths() for fetching data at build time.
- Use Astro.glob() for working with local files efficiently.
- Implement proper error handling for data fetching operations.

SEO and Meta Tags

- Use Astro's <head> tag for adding meta information.
- Implement canonical URLs for proper SEO.
- Use the <SEO> component pattern for reusable SEO setups.

Integrations and Plugins

- Use official Astro integrations:
  - @astrojs/react for React support
  - @astrojs/tailwind for Tailwind CSS
- Implement proper configuration for integrations in astro.config.mjs.

Build and Deployment

- Optimize the build process using Astro's build command.
- Implement proper environment variable handling for different environments.
- Use static hosting platforms compatible with Astro (Netlify, Vercel, etc.).
- Implement proper CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and deployments.

Styling with Tailwind CSS

- Use Tailwind CSS v4 with CSS-first configuration
- Define theme customizations using @theme directive
- Follow Shadcn UI's component styling patterns
- Never use @apply directive (as per project standards)

Tailwind v4 Best Practices

- Use Tailwind utility classes extensively in your Astro components.
- Leverage Tailwind's responsive design utilities (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.).
- Use CSS variables for theme customization
- Implement custom variants using @custom-variant directive
- Never use the @apply directive

Testing

- Implement unit tests for utility functions and helpers.
- Use end-to-end testing tools like Cypress for testing the built site.
- Implement visual regression testing if applicable.

Accessibility

- Ensure proper semantic HTML structure in Astro components.
- Implement ARIA attributes where necessary.
- Ensure keyboard navigation support for interactive elements.

Key Conventions

1. Follow Astro's Style Guide for consistent code formatting.
2. Use TypeScript for enhanced type safety and developer experience.
3. Implement proper error handling and logging.
4. Leverage Astro's RSS feed generation for content-heavy sites.
5. Use Astro's Image component for optimized image delivery.

Performance Metrics

- Prioritize Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) in development.
- Use Lighthouse and WebPageTest for performance auditing.
- Implement performance budgets and monitoring.

Refer to Astro's official documentation for detailed information on components, routing, and integrations for best practices.
